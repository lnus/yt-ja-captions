# This doesn't have a name *yet*

~~I want to watch YouTube videos with a better
caption display and some *extra* stuff.~~

I'm actually just going to process the captions for now.

## TO-DO

- [x] Get video metadata and captions
- [x] Actually make that work ^
- [ ] Figure out how to store/model data
- [ ] Add frequency graph for words
- [ ] Rank words/kanji based on JLPT level
- [ ] Rank videos based on frequency and difficulty
- [ ] Write REST API, maybe
