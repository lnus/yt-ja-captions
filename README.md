# This doesn't have a name *yet*

I want to watch YouTube videos with a better
caption display and some *extra* stuff.

## TO-DO

[x] - Get video metadata and captions
[ ] - Figure out how to store/model data
[ ] - Add frequency graph for words
[ ] - Rank words/kanji based on JLPT level
[ ] - Rank videos based on frequency and difficulty
[ ] - Write REST API, maybe

Either REST and iframes on frontend or
just write as media server with downloads.

Not sure; writing everything as
small packages for now so I can extend easily as needed.
